Disclaimer
=================================
Google has not created these sample projects, or the tutorials that go along with them.  They were all created by me.


SETUP
=================================

Make sure you create your own client ID in https://console.developers.google.com/ any client IDs in these projects are development ones which will be deleted periodically.

Due to a recent change in the Google api terms of service the Client ids in these projects have been deleted.  They will not work you will need to create your own for testing.   Any of the samples that require beta access will require that you apply for beta access for your account.  I can no longer share my client id and access with you.
